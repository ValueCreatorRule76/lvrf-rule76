# LVRF — Build Status

**28 July 2026.** Build officially commenced.

---

## Constitutional state

| Instrument | Status |
|---|---|
| `AMENDMENT-001` — Chapel reorientation, LVAF→LVRF, Learning ROI struck | **Ratified** |
| `AMENDMENT-002` — Heartbeat Register extension, HB-0013..0018 | **Ratified** |
| `AMENDMENT-003` — Financial as seventh health dimension | **Ratified** |
| `AMENDMENT-004` — Pack as Cathedral canonical object | Not drafted |

All three ratified amendments are implemented in code. Governance and implementation are
in step — no drift outstanding.

---

## Built and verified

**Infrastructure** — VPS `srv1862778`: Postgres 16.14 (checksums on, 8GB tuning, localhost),
pgvector 0.6.0, Node 24.18.0, Caddy with valid certs on `lvrf-rule76.com` proxying
`127.0.0.1:3001`, nightly `pg_dump`, ufw 22/80/443, fail2ban, key-only SSH, 2GB swap.

**Local dev** — Mac: Node 24.18.0, Postgres 16.14, database `lvrf` / role `lvrf_app`,
VS Code with Claude Code.

**Schema** — `db/schema.ts`: 18 tables, 13 enums, 13 CHECK constraints.
`db/hardening.sql`: audit + delete-guard triggers on 12 governed tables (24 total), append-only
privileges on `audit_log` and `heartbeat_events`.
`db/seed_heartbeat_register.sql`: 18 heartbeats, all seven categories populated.

**Value spine** — `records/simulate_spine.py` walks all seven stages, emits register-compliant
heartbeats with SHA-256 hashes, computes institutional health across seven dimensions with
unmeasured dimensions excluded from the denominator, and derives confidence from the evidence
ledger across six weighted factors.

**Documents** — `records/render_record.py` produces the Realization Record via WeasyPrint.

---

## First spine run — customer zero

| | |
|---|---|
| Heartbeats emitted | 10, all registered |
| Value delta | +2.4 points, 120% of target |
| Institutional health | 88.3 · WATCH · 90% coverage |
| Realization | **measured** — verification refused |
| Disclosure | **internal** — not customer-releasable |
| Computed confidence | **30 / 100 · LOW** |
| Findings | 3 |

The run's most important behaviour is what it declined to do. Verification was refused
because evidence supporting the measured actual was not source-verified and no human
verifier was of record.

---

## Use A and Use B — both walked, 29 July

| | Use A · customer zero | Use B · Northgate Utilities |
|---|---|---|
| What is measured | The **vendor's** sales capability | A **customer's** workforce capability |
| Metric | Skillsoft LTM dollar retention | Customer TRIR, per OSHA 300A |
| Direction | increase | **decrease** — first test of that path |
| Evidence | public filing + unverified simulation | **attested** by customer authorities |
| Delta | +2.4, 120% of target | −0.34, 106% of target |
| Institutional health | 88.3 · WATCH | 99.1 · HEALTHY |
| Confidence | **30 / 100 · LOW** | **80 / 100 · HIGH** |
| Realization | **measured** — refused | **verified** |
| Disclosure | internal | customer_shared |

Use B is the engagement shape the value engineering role actually performs. Use A proves
the mechanism; it does not demonstrate the job.

### Attestation credit — the design decision behind it

A vendor cannot independently verify a customer's internal figure; it has no access to the
customer's system of record. Without a middle tier, 50 of 100 confidence points would be
permanently unreachable and the product unusable for its purpose.

Two concepts were separated:

- **The gate** (`source_verified`) asks whether the source was confirmed **by an authority
  over it**. A public filing is self-authoritative. A customer's internal metric is
  authoritative when the customer's own metric owner attests to it. Attestation therefore
  clears the gate, and Use B records can reach `verified`.
- **Confidence** asks how **strong** that confirmation is. Attestation earns
  `ATTESTATION_CREDIT = 0.6`, because a management representation is weaker than
  substantive testing.

`0.6` is chosen so a flawlessly executed Use B record scores exactly **80** — the floor of
HIGH. It must do everything right to get there, and **cannot exceed 80 without genuine
independent verification.** That ceiling is deliberate and is printed on the document.

An attestation counts only if the attester is **institution-scoped and real**. A vendor
attesting to a customer's number is an assertion wearing a signature.

---

## 0001 — Defect 2 closed, verifier role added

Schema patched and validated (drizzle-kit 0.31.10, drizzle-orm 0.45.2). Generates:

- **12 self-referencing `superseded_by_fk`** — one per governed table, `ON DELETE restrict`.
  Declared in each table's config array via `foreignKey()`, because a shared `governance()`
  helper cannot express a self-reference. On `heartbeats` the column is `text` and correctly
  targets the register's text primary key.
- **12 `steward_person_id → persons.id`** — resolved with a lazy `AnyPgColumn` thunk, which
  is what permits the `tenants → persons → tenants` cycle and the `persons` self-reference.
- **`personRole` gains `value_verifier`.** HB-0016 requires a named human verifier and the
  enum had no value for one. Named by **function, not department** — the authority may sit
  in Finance, Internal Audit or RevOps.

**Defect 2 is closed.** The orphaned-relation class is now structurally impossible on every
governed table.

### Separation of duties — API-enforced, not schema-enforced

A `value_verifier` must not also be the `metric_owner` for the same metric, and for a
customer's metric must be **institution-scoped**. Neither rule can be a CHECK — both span
tables. They live in the route and must not be removed.

---

## Confirmation gap engine — built 29 July

`records/confirmation_gap.py`. AMENDMENT-001 Article II assigned LVRF ownership of
Confirmation Gap; nothing computed it until now.

**Design decision: the gap is a portfolio instrument, not a record one.** A single
outcome's target-versus-actual is arithmetic. The question a finance function actually
asks is *"when this function gives me a number, how wrong is it usually, and in which
direction?"* — a property of a body of records. Direction is weighted above magnitude: a
practice consistently 10% conservative is trustworthy; one consistently 10% optimistic is
not, at identical absolute error.

**It refuses below n=5.** Portfolio bias is not reported over an insufficient population —
same discipline as the health model reporting UNMEASURED rather than assuming compliance.
Dispersion requires n=12.

### First run — the distinction that matters

| Outcome | Confirmed | Admissible |
|---|---|---|
| Northgate · TRIR 1.42→1.08 vs target 1.10 | **yes** — 106.2% of claim | **yes** |
| Skillsoft · DRR 98→100.4 vs target 100.0 | **yes** — 120.0% of claim | **no** |

The Skillsoft outcome hit its target and is still excluded, because realization is
`measured` rather than `verified`. **A claim you cannot substantiate earns no credit toward
the practice's record, even when it happens to be right.** Portfolio bias therefore reads
NOT REPORTED at 1 admissible outcome.

### Two schema gaps it cannot work around → 0002

1. **Currency confirmation.** `value_outcomes.currency_impact` is a single column.
   Confirming a currency claim needs the amount claimed **at commit** and realized **at
   verify** as separate values. Requires `claimed_currency_impact` and
   `realized_currency_impact`. **This blocks the dollar confirmation gap — the metric a CFO
   cares about most.**
2. **Measurement punctuality.** No `promised_measured_at`, so slippage between the
   committed measurement date and the actual one is uncomputable. A practice that always
   delivers *late* is a distinct failure from one that delivers *short*, and the engine
   cannot currently tell them apart.

Both surfaced by executing, not by review. That is now four findings from running code
against zero from thirteen specification volumes.

---

## 0001 — folded, not yet generated

The three confirmation-gap columns were folded into the same migration as Defect 2 and the
verifier role. One migration, not two. **Schema validated; migration not yet generated or
applied.**

`value_outcomes` now carries:

| Column | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `claimed_currency_impact` | The figure asserted at `commit` |
| `realized_currency_impact` | The figure measured at `verify` |
| `promised_measured_at` | The measurement date committed to |

`currency_impact` is **renamed** to `claimed_currency_impact`. `drizzle-kit generate` will
prompt interactively — choose **rename**, not create. Safe: nothing in `value_outcomes` is
real data.

Two constraints updated or added:

- `value_outcomes_impact_requires_basis` — extended to cover both figures. No unexplained
  money, claimed or realized.
- `value_outcomes_realized_requires_measurement` — a realized figure cannot exist while
  realization is still `claimed`. Prevents back-filling an outcome with a result it never
  measured.

**Why two columns and not one.** A single `currency_impact` silently overwrites the claim
with the outcome, which erases the only evidence the claim was ever wrong — precisely the
record a finance function wants. The confirmation gap engine names this as the metric a CFO
cares about most, and it was uncomputable until now.

### Apply order

```
pg_dump -Fc lvrf > ~/Backups/lvrf/pre-0001.dump
npx drizzle-kit generate        # answer "rename" at the prompt
cat db/drizzle/0001_*.sql       # read before applying
npx drizzle-kit migrate
```

Expect **24 ADD CONSTRAINT**, one `ALTER TYPE ... ADD VALUE 'value_verifier'`, three new
columns, one rename, two CHECK changes.

---

## 0002 — applied 1 August. AMENDMENT-005 evidence columns, value_runs, disclosure link

Migration `0002_sloppy_cerebro.sql` generated from the patched schema and applied to the
local `lvrf` database (`pg_dump` to `~/Backups/lvrf/pre-0002.dump` first). Six governed-research
columns and three CHECKs on `evidence`; `value_runs` (25 columns, 7 FKs, two self-referencing);
`record_documents.value_run_id`. No drops.

Both 0002 triggers are installed in `db/hardening.sql` §5 and applied live — trigger count
36 → **38**. The locked-run trigger is verified to bite: an UPDATE against a locked run
raises; `superseded_by_id` remains writable, which is how a relock records replacement.

### Rules the API must carry — now three

None may be removed without an amendment.

1. **Separation of duties.** A `value_verifier` must not also be the `metric_owner` for the
   same metric, and for a customer's metric must be institution-scoped. (0001, above.)
2. **The actor-context transaction.** Every mutation route sets
   `lvrf.actor_person_id` per transaction so the audit trigger can attribute the write.
3. **Disclosure requires a locked run.** `record_documents.disclosure = 'customer_shared'`
   requires the referenced `value_run` to be **locked**. Spans tables; cannot be a CHECK.

## 0002 applied — 1 August

Migration `0002_sloppy_cerebro.sql`. Backup taken first. Verified against the live database:

- `value_runs` — 25 columns, 7 FKs including two self-referencing
- `evidence` — 6 AMENDMENT-005 columns, 3 new CHECKs
- `record_documents.value_run_id` present
- 18 seeded heartbeats intact
- **38 distinct triggers**, up from 36

### Finding — a locked run is permanent

Discovered by testing rather than design. `lvrf_locked_run_immutable` permits exactly one
column to change after a lock — `superseded_by_id`. `deleted_at` is not on that list, so
**a locked run cannot be soft-deleted.** It cannot be hard-deleted either; it is a governed
table.

Verified:

| Attempt on a locked run | Result |
|---|---|
| `UPDATE confidence_score` | **REFUSED** — trigger raises |
| `UPDATE superseded_by_id` | `UPDATE 1` — the one permitted change |
| `UPDATE deleted_at, status='retired'` | **REFUSED** |
| Insert a new run with `supersedes_run_id` | `INSERT 0 1` — the correct exit |

**This is kept deliberately.** A locked run is the version the institution said it would
defend. Permitting retirement means a value case can be quietly withdrawn after the fact,
and the confirmation gap depends on refuted claims surviving — a practice that can delete
its bad runs is not measuring itself, it is curating. Same reasoning as the phantom audit
rows in `DEFECT-001`: history that can be tidied proves nothing.

**Consequence:** unlocked runs are retirable; **locked runs are forever.** Locking is
therefore a consequential act, which it should be. The exit is to supersede, which records
that the run was replaced and by what.

Not filed as an amendment — it is a consequence of a ratified principle rather than a new
one.

### Rollback note

Two statements in a single `psql -c` share one implicit transaction. When the second
raised, the first rolled back with it. Useful confirmation that a failed trigger leaves no
partial state — and a reminder to run destructive tests as separate invocations.

### Note — one record_document predates value_runs

One row in `record_documents`, rendered 29 July, `document_version = 1`,
`disclosure = internal`, `value_run_id NULL`. It predates `value_runs` and the
`record_documents` payload shape changed during 0003 prep, so its `content_hash`
can no longer be reproduced from current code.

**Not a defect.** The document never left the institution — `internal`, never
`customer_shared` — so no external party holds a hash that fails to resolve. The row is
accurate about what it was.

**Not rewritten.** `record_documents` is governed and versioned on
`(value_outcome_id, document_version)`. The next render produces version 2 with a
reproducible hash; version 1 stands as the record of what was rendered before the shape
changed. Same principle as the phantom audit rows in `DEFECT-001` — history accumulates
rather than being tidied.

### Note — Customer Zero's value_runs start at run_number 3, not 1

The locked-run trigger tests above (**Finding — a locked run is permanent**) inserted their
proof rows directly against the Customer Zero engagement: `run_number` 999 (locked,
`confidence_score = 80.0`) and 1000 (unlocked, `confidence_score = 0.0`). Both are manual
test fixtures, not walk output.

`walkSpine.ts`'s own runs against that engagement therefore land at `run_number` 3 and 4,
not 1 and 2 — `run_number` is computed as a count of existing rows for the engagement plus
one, and it counted the two test rows correctly. **Run 999 is left in place deliberately**
— locked and permanent by design, it is the standing proof that
`lvrf_locked_run_immutable` works. Recorded here so a future reader of `value_runs` does
not mistake run 4 for the fourth real walk of this engagement; it is the second. Use B's
engagement was untouched before 0003 testing, so its runs there are a clean 1 and 2.

---

## Rules enforced in the API, not the schema

Three, each spanning tables and therefore beyond a CHECK. **None may be removed without an
amendment.**

| # | Rule | Where |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Actor context — every mutating request sets `lvrf.actor_person_id` inside the transaction, or audit rows record a null actor | `server/middleware/actorContext.ts` |
| 2 | Separation of duties — a `value_verifier` may not be the `metric_owner` for the same metric; for a customer's metric the verifier must be institution-scoped | verification route |
| 3 | **`record_documents.disclosure = 'customer_shared'` requires the referenced `value_run` to be locked** | document route |
| 4 | Attestation credit (0.6) requires `evidence.attested_by_person_id` to resolve to an institution-scoped, non-synthetic person — a CHECK can enforce the pairing of `attested_by_person_id`/`attested_at` (`evidence_attestation_is_complete`) but not the cross-table scope test | `evidenceCredit()`, `server/spine/confidenceModel.ts` |

Rule 3 is the connection between locking and the disclosure gate: an unlocked run is
exploratory, and exploratory work does not go to a customer.

**Known weakness on rule 1.** The actor is currently read from an `X-Actor-Person-Id`
header, which any caller can set. An audit log that can be forged is worse than none — it
manufactures confidence. Must be fail-closed outside development before the first mutation
route ships.

---

## Not built — next, in priority order

1. **Wire the confirmation gap to the two new columns** once 0001 is applied. `AMENDMENT-001` Article II assigned LVRF ownership of
   Confirmation Gap. Nothing computes it.
4. **Industry Pack model.** Two axes, not one: vertical packs (industry → metric library,
   attestation authority, regulatory overlay) crossed with horizontal packs (role family →
   capability set). Build **one** pack. Six is the thirteen-volumes error in a new costume.
   A pack supplies content, never presentation.

  Proposal filed: `R76-LVRF-PROP-001` in `docs/proposals/` (HTML + PDF, Proposed status,
  2026-08-03).
5. **Repo scaffold and first migration.** Nothing is deployed. No API, no UI.
6. **Portfolio view.** Tier-2 motion needs cross-engagement visibility.

---

## Open Cathedral items — deliberately deferred

Catch the repository up after the build has produced something to learn from.

- LVAF → LVRF correction across ~17 documents (ratified in A1, not executed)
- Compass hierarchy contradiction: parent in two diagrams, sibling in a third
- `COMPASS-RECONSTRUCTION-STATUS` readiness percentages (A1 Article VII)
- CDS-001 Volumes I–XII: still Version 1.0, unratified, superseded in substance
- Repository Constitution IN PROGRESS — `record_documents` remains provisional
- Whether Stone III exists as a document; the Inheritance Audit's certification rests on it

---

## The pattern worth keeping

Three of the four material findings in this program came from **executing**, not reviewing:

- **F1** — the missing seventh health dimension, found when the health calculator had two
  events with no dimension to map to and declined to invent one
- **The Heartbeat Register gap** — no financial or learning heartbeat existed; the foreign
  key refused the emission
- **Confidence at 30/100** — the number only became knowable once it was computed rather
  than asserted

Thirteen specification volumes produced none.

---

## LVRF 1.0 Foundation — complete 23 August 2026

Foundation is the read path: a governed value run, in production, that computes a
defensible confidence score, discloses its own provenance, and refuses to publish
what it cannot defend — enforced at the database, not in the application.

Foundation does **not** include the write path. The system can refuse evidence but
cannot yet accept it. Items below marked deferred are named deliberately, not dropped.

### Complete — verified live, not inferred

- Production at lvrf-rule76.com / srv1862778, Postgres 16.14, migrations 0000-0009
- 41 non-internal triggers plus five CHECK constraints on `value_outcomes`:
  `commit_is_complete`, `impact_requires_basis`, `measured_requires_actual`,
  `realized_requires_measurement`, `verified_requires_human`
- Customer Zero run 88f6a6e1: 30.0 / low / 88.3 / watch. Production carries one run
- Skillsoft catalog: 12 offerings, 8/8 constraint proof, 22/22 gate tests
- DEFECT-005: index route at `/` with `source_fixture` as a PROVENANCE column
- DEFECT-006: `/assets/*` served without try_files. Verified 200 / 404 / 200
- DEFECT-004: backup validates via pg_restore --list before atomic publish. 299 TOC entries
- scripts/lvrf-deploy.sh: client build step, mtime guard, post-deploy API and vhost checks
- Design system compliant with AMENDMENT-004. Canonical tokens, no hex in components
- RULE | 76 lockup renders above the LVRF mark — chapel subordination legible
- Unbuilt actions disclosed as unbuilt rather than styled as live

### Deferred — named, not dropped

- **Write path.** Add evidence and Render record are inert
- **Verifier attestation.** Nothing can satisfy `verified_requires_human`
- **Run lineage and compare.** No second run exists; no before-and-after possible
- **Record document.** Nothing renders a PDF a CFO could hand a lender
- **DEFECT-E remainder.** The simulation banner is authored prose, not derived
- **Confidence model.** Six weighted factors; weights not traced to a table, not versioned
- **DEFECT-003.** Production apply pending; four composite-key tables uncovered
- **LVRF emblem.** Metallic gradient is off-system. "STUDIO" and the trademark mark
  appear nowhere in the record
- Raw ISO timestamp on the index. Asset PNGs outweigh the JS bundle 2.4x

### Register — findings from 22-23 August

- Local and production hold different data. Production was rebuilt from migrations;
  local carries 2 August seed work including 11 `customer_b` rows. A clean local
  render proves nothing about production
- PROVENANCE UNKNOWN (8) and NOT MEASURED (10) are deliberately different sets.
  Health fields arrived in a later migration than `source_fixture`. Do not reconcile
- `ops/lvrf-backup.sh` mirrors `/usr/local/bin/lvrf-backup.sh`. Nothing enforces it.
  Cron runs the latter as root via /etc/cron.d/lvrf-backup
- `ops/Caddyfile` is a sanitized template, NOT a mirror — it carries a placeholder
  where the bcrypt hash lives. A drift check against /etc/caddy/ would false-alarm
- The server deploy key is read-only. Production cannot push, by design
- lvrf-deploy.sh reports "deploy OK" on a no-op. "No new commits" would be accurate
- basic_auth credential rotated 23 August 2026 following exposure
- Root `npm run build` compiles the server only. This is why twenty days of client
  work sat undeployed. Fixed in the deploy script; the npm script itself is unchanged

---

## Heartbeat register — verified 23 August 2026

Two findings, and both halves matter.

### The health model is correct and reconciles

`server/spine/healthModel.ts` implements db/HEALTH_MODEL.md — seven dimensions
weighted to 100, each fed by heartbeat events mapped through
`CATEGORY_TO_DIMENSION`. A dimension with no events is UNMEASURED: never scored
zero, never assumed compliant, and excluded from the composite's denominator.
The exclusion is published as `coverage_pct` alongside the composite.

Reconciled by hand against production, 23 August. Six of seven categories have
events — operational, governance, integrity, financial, learning, constitutional.
Only `security` is absent. Measured weight is therefore 25 + 25 + 15 + 10 + 10 + 5
= 90, and `health_coverage_pct` reads exactly 90. The number falls out of the model
from real event data, not from a fixture.

Note that `verifyConfidenceParity.ts` hardcodes `coveragePct: 90` as an expected
value. That is a parity test, not the source of the figure — the arithmetic above
was derived independently from the events table.

`institutional_health` 88.3 is weighted faithfulness across 90% of defined
dimension weight, with Security excluded rather than assumed compliant. This is
defensible arithmetic and the exclusion principle is the same instinct as
`verified_requires_human`.

### The register is seeded, not live

All ten rows in `heartbeat_events` carry the identical timestamp
`2026-08-03 04:41:31.405125+00` — written in one transaction during the initial
spine walk. Nothing has emitted an event since.

Consequences:

- HB-0001 System Initialization declares "every startup". The API has restarted
  many times since 3 August. Zero events
- HB-0002 Authentication and HB-0003 Authorization have never fired. This is
  precisely why the Security dimension is unmeasured — the model is reporting
  the gap accurately
- HB-0011 Heartbeat Health Calculated and HB-0012 Institutional Health Published
  have never fired. The score is published without recording that it was computed
- HB-0010 Constitution Reviewed, weight 10 severity 5, has never fired across
  every governed change made this month

The seeded events are honest — HB-0016 Value Verified sits at `warning` severity 5,
matching the refusal rendered on screen. Nothing is fake-healthy.

But 88.3 describes 3 August, and the interface does not say so. A reader would
have to inspect `occurred_at` to know.

### Deferred to 2.0 Band A

Runtime heartbeat emission. Every governed action writes an event; health
recomputes from a live register rather than a snapshot. This is the same tranche
as the write path — they are one piece of work, not two.

Until then: the model is an instrument, the register is a photograph.

---

## Release structure — ratified 23 August 2026

Supersedes the "Deferred to 2.0 Band A" framing used earlier in this file. Those
items were misfiled: the write path completes Foundation rather than enhancing it.
Earlier entries stand as written; this section governs.

Three tiers, each with a boundary that can be tested rather than asserted.

### 1.0 Foundation — CLOSED 23 August 2026

The read path. A governed value run, in production, that computes a defensible
confidence score, discloses its own provenance, and refuses to publish what it
cannot defend — enforced at the database, not in the application.

Test: a stranger can open the system, see a value run, and determine from the
interface alone what is evidenced, what is asserted, and what is refused.

Closed. Every item verified live rather than inferred. See the Foundation section
above for the full inventory.

### 1.2 Complete system — NOT STARTED

The write path, and everything that closes the loop.

- Add evidence writes through the gate. The four CHECK constraints and
  `lvrf_block_ai_actual` fire on real input, not seeded rows
- Verifier attestation. Something must be able to satisfy
  `value_outcomes_verified_requires_human` — named person, timestamp, and what
  they attested to
- A second run. Lineage and compare. The before-and-after does not currently exist
- Record document rendered. `record_documents` is an empty table; the rendered
  artifact is the actual output of the system
- Runtime heartbeat emission. Health recomputes from a live register rather than
  the 3 August snapshot
- `_no_delete` on `heartbeat_events` and `record_documents`. Both are evidence
  substrate and both are currently deletable without trace

Test: **a real cohort can be measured end to end by someone other than the author,
and the output is a document a CFO would carry to a lender.** If that is not true,
the system is in 1.2 regardless of how many items are ticked.

Sequencing note: 1.2 should not be built speculatively. Every item exists because
a real engagement needs it. Build the write path against an actual cohort's data,
not against an assumption about what that cohort will have. Building the wrong loop
carefully is worse than building nothing.

### 2.0 Enhancements — SCOPED, NOT COMMITTED

Additive. Each assumes 1.2 works.

- Cohort roll-up, with composite confidence derived from the weakest link rather
  than averaged. Averaging launders the gaps
- Gap register as a product surface. What each missing input costs to obtain and
  what it buys in confidence. Turns a diagnosis into a decision
- Confidence model weights versioned as data, with a changelog, and every run
  recording which model version scored it. Tuning a weight currently makes every
  prior score silently incomparable
- Portfolio learning across engagements

Explicitly out of scope for all three tiers: multi-tenancy, user management,
dashboards, third-party integrations, industry packs. Named here so they are
deferred rather than quietly assumed.
